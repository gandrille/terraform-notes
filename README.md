# üèóÔ∏è Terraform notes

Here are personal notes I have written while preparing [HashiCorp Terraform Associate (003) certification](https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/terraform-associate).

The sources can be easily edited using [zim](https://zim-wiki.org/), an open source personal wiki available for [download on the official website](https://zim-wiki.org/downloads.html).

Using GitHub Actions, the content of this repository is also available as:
