====== 13. Final notes ======
This documentation was created in order to prepare HashCorp Terraform certification-003. Knowing all this content should be enough in order to get certified (no guarantee of course, but I was certified in 2023).

**TODO**
* A dedicated section explaining state in details should be created based on https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state
* For expression should be explained inside [[:03. Variables|Variable]] section
* [[:11. Terraform Cloud|Terraform Cloud]] section is a bit weak, even if some knowlede is mandatory in order to be certified
