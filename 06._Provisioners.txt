====== 06. Provisioners ======
Provisioners are used to execute scripts on a local or remote machine as part of resource creation or destruction.
Scripts can be executed on resource creation (default) or destruction.

**Important: Use provisioners as a last resort. There are better alternatives for most situations.**
See: [[https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/syntax|Provisioners syntax]]


===== Remote exec =====
The ''remote-exec'' provisioner invokes a script on a remote resource after it is created.
The connection can use ''ssh'' or ''WinRM''.

'''
resource "aws_instance" "myec2" {
  ami           = "ami-0ca285d4c2cda3300"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = "terraform-key"
  # default sg used here. Be sure that it allows port 80 and 22
  connection {
    type        = "ssh"
    user        = "ec2-user"
    private_key = file("./terraform-key.pem")
    host        = self.public_ip
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      # Updating with the latest command for Amazon Linux machine
      "sudo yum install -y nginx",
      "sudo systemctl start nginx"
    ]
  }
}
'''


===== Local exec =====
The ''local-exec'' provisioner invokes a local executable after a resource is created.

'''
resource "aws_instance" "myec2" {
  ami           = "ami-082b5a644766e0e6f"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo ${aws_instance.myec2.private_ip} >> ips.txt"
  }
}
'''

→ With the ''local-exec'', the attribute name is ''command'', which is a ''string''.


===== On destroy =====
'''
# I agree, this example is a bit silly
provisioner "remote-exec" {
  when = destroy
  inline = [
    "sudo yum -y remove nano"
  ]
}
'''

→ With the ''remote-exec'', the attribute name is ''inline'', which is a ''list(string)''.


===== Failure management =====
By default, provisioners that fail will also cause the terraform apply itself to fail.

The ''on_failure'' setting can be used to change this. The allowed values are:
* ''continue'' Ignore the error and continue with creation or destruction.
* ''fail'' Raise an error and stop applying (the default behavior)
