====== 11. Terraform Cloud ======
https://www.hashicorp.com/cloud
* Supported OS: everything except Unix and Android
* VCS providers: GitHub, BitBucket, Azure DevOps server, Azure DevOps services

**Workspace management**
* NOT the same as the open source flavor
* Integration with GIT repositories
* Automatic plan on commit (and one click apply!)
* Variables management

**Sentinel**
Sentinel is an embedded policy-as-code framework
* Policy controls to make apply fail
* Only available with paid plans!
â†’ IMPORTANT: policies are only enforced at Terraform Cloud level... we still can do what we want on AWS directly...
