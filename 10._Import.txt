====== 10. Import ======
===== BEFORE Terraform 1.5: the CLI =====
See: [[https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import|import CLI]]

The ''terraform import'' CLI command can only import resources into the state. Importing via the CLI does not generate configuration.
Before you run ''terraform import'' you must manually write a resource configuration block for the resource. The resource block describes where Terraform should map the imported object.


===== WITH Terraform 1.5.0: the import Block =====
See: [[https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import|import block]]

''terraform import'' can create the ''resource.tf'' file from the remote infrastructure element to be imported !


**import.tf**
'''
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-1"
}

# After importing, you can optionally remove import blocks from your configuration
# or leave them as a record of the resource's origin.
import {
  to = aws_security_group.mysg
  id = "sg-07f13feb262ba8b6f"
}
'''

**Command To Autogenerate Code for Imported Resource**
''terraform plan -generate-config-out=mysg.tf''
Note : ''-generate-config-out'' flag may change in future releases. See documentation.

**Command To Generate the Final State file**
''terraform apply -auto-approve''
