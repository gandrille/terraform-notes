See: [[https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state/workspaces|Workspaces]]

Workspaces allow multiple state files of a single configuration. Most of the time, each workspace has a different set of environment variables associated.
Not suitable for isolation for strong separation between workspace (stage/prod)
→ One codebase, several environments (dev1, dev2,...)
→ State File Directory: ''terraform.tfstate.d/dev1'', ''terraform.tfstate.d/dev2'',...

**Commands**
* ''terraform workspace new'' Create a new workspace
* ''terraform workspace list'' List Workspaces
* ''terraform workspace select'' Select a workspace
* ''terraform workspace show'' Show the name of the current workspace
